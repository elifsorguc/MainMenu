BOOKWORM PROJECT

Firstly, since we mainly focused on getting the application to work, we did not put any 
effort into its appearance. We would like to add more pictures and make it more enjoyable 
to use. If we had more time we would not eliminate some of the features and we would 
implement all of the features we said we would do in the first place. If the database were 
to be fixed things would have been easier for us but in the last minute we just came face to
face with the fact that new error were popping up and that we were unable to solve them. 
However, despite all of this dissatisfaction, this was a great experience in our app 
development journey. The little achievements we had throughout the process made us 
incredibly happy and if we had more time, we would have definitely completed a decent app. 
In anyways, we did the best we could, we had a couple of sleepless nights and most 
importantly we had a lot of fun while creating this application with all of that learnings 
that we did.

Some of us learned what a database is and how it works and others learned android studio. 
However, the most important thing was that we learned how to be compatible with group 
members and how to overcome problems together.

We could have started a bit early and put more effort on the database because our app mostly
depends on the database. Also, we could have focused on main aspects of the project instead 
of putting a lot of details in it.
We spent a lot of time on the Navigation drawer and such little things. We should have made 
an efficient plan to make the project work.
