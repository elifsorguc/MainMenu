Our app stores sign up and sign in datas in Firestore and make authentications correctly. 
When there is already an email that is used, the app does not accept a second sign up attempt. 
We implemented database code correctly. However, we could not get data from the firestore. 
We faced problems while integrating firebase to android studio, so we spent much time on it.
Android studio works correctly. However, there is a lot of stuff to implement, so it took a 
lot of time and we could not pay sufficiently on the database. Even though we made admin xml 
and java pages, we could not integrate admin pages to our app accordingly because of lack of 
time and database issues.
We used;
Android Studio Chipmunk 2021.2.1 Patch 1
Firebase- Firestore cloud
Google libraries for database.
